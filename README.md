![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
